# Release checklist

- run `pana` and check score is 120/120
- Bump version in `pubspec.yaml`
- Make sure `prod` backend is used, not `dev`
- Increment `wiredashSdkVersion` in `lib/src/version.dart` by `1` for patch releases, by `10` for minor releases
- Write release notes in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Commit changes
- Tag release `vX.Y.Z` and push it
- Double check that there are no local changes, then run `git stash && flutter pub publish`
- Update/Move the `stable`, `beta` and `dev` branches (Run `./tool/update_branches.sh`)
- Copy paste release notes into github release
- Update latest SDK version in `console`
- Announce release on Twitter ðŸŽ‰
