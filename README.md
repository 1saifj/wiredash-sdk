Wiredash is probably the easiest and most convenient way to capture in-app user feedback, wishes, ratings and much more. The SDK is completely written in Dart and runs on Android, iOS, Desktop and the Web. For more info, head over to [wiredash.io](https://wiredash.io). 
  
## Getting Started  
  
In order to get started, you need to create an account at [wiredash.io](https://wiredash.io) - you do this by simply signing in with a valid Google or GitHub account.

### Setting up your Flutter project

After successfully creating a new project in the Wiredash admin console it's time to add Wiredash to your app. Simply open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the current version of Wiredash as a dependency, e.g. `wiredash: 0.1.0`. Make sure to get the newest version.

Now get all pub packages by clicking on `Packages get` in your IDE or executing `flutter packages get` inside your Flutter project.

Head over to the main entry point of your app which most likely resides inside `main.dart`. In here wrap your root widget inside a `Wiredash` widget and provide your API credentials and your app's navigator key as parameters. That was already the hard part ðŸ™Œ

```dart
void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final _navigatorKey = GlobalKey<NavigatorState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Wiredash(
      projectId: "YOUR-PROJECT-ID",
      secret: "YOUR-SECRET",
      navigatorKey: _navigatorKey,
      child: MaterialApp(
        navigatorKey: _navigatorKey,
        title: 'Flutter Demo',
        home: ...
      ),
    );
  }  
}
```

Now you can call `Wiredash.of(context).show()` from anywhere inside your app to start the feedback process!

#### Passing build information to Wiredash

If you want to receive information about build number and specific commit related to the feedback you can pass additional parameters to your `flutter build` command. Most of the CI platforms define some common environment variables containing current build number and SHA of commit used to build the app. For instance, on Codemagic these are `BUILD_NUMBER` and `FCI_COMMIT` respectively.

To receive this build information along with your feedback you mast pass `--dart-define` flag to your `flutter build` command as follows:

```sh
flutter build --dart-define=BUILD_NUMBER=$BUILD_NUMBER --dart-define=BUILD_COMMIT=$FCI_COMMIT
```

Of course you can also use any other value or variable like `--dart-define=BUILD_NUMBER="1.0.9"`.

Be aware that this feature was added in [Flutter 1.17](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/release-notes/changelogs/changelog-1.17.0) and won't work in previous versions.

### Android / iOS specific setup

Wiredash is by design written in Dart and relies on very few dependencies by the official Flutter team. However, when running on Android it needs the internet permission (for sending user feedback back to you). If you already use Flutter in production, chances are quite high that you already added the internet permission to the manifest - if not, add the following line to the `AndroidManifest.xml` in your Android project folder:

```xml
<manifest ...>
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
 <application ...
</manifest>
```

That's it!
